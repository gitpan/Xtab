This is Date::Xtab, version 0.70 

REQUIRED COMPONENTS
===================

You will need the following modules:

CGI
GD
GIFgraph

all of which can be found on CPAN. Start at http://www.perl.com to make your
way towards these modules. These modules may have other dependencies, so you 
should consult the documentation for each module, and ensure that they install 
correctly and pass 'make test'.

INSTALLATION
============

In order to install this, you should enter the top-level directory
of the distribution, and issue the following commands:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make install

There are no tests for this module, but there is a test.cgi script, 
which will display a GIF in your web browser if it is run as a CGI 
script under your web server.

NOTES
=====

Documentation is contained within the module (Xtab.pm) in pod format;
when you issue the installation commands, you should then be able to type:

  man Data::Xtab

or:

  perldoc Data::Xtab


to get the whole story.

Have fun,
